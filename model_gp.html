    <h3>GETTING STARTED</h3>
    <p>Before  getting started in creating the websites of mine I researched about how my portfolio
     should look like and what are the things that should be included in the websites since I don't 
     have any idea and I am new in the field of designing websites. So, I did a research for this .
     Through different websites found in the internet I got many more ideas about the different layout
     and contents that are to be mentioned in the websites.During the research I found that almost 
     every websites were attractive and beautiful because of the good quality of css,animiation,hover effects, transition property used by them.Those websites were also user friendly.But I also 
     found that some of the websites were made using javascript and bootstraps.But as per the requirement given inthe assignment The websites should be completed using htl and css using different property like animation,transition,hover etc.

    <h3>DEVELOPMENT OF WEBSITES</h3>

    <h3>EVIDENCES OF USING MODELS OF GP</h3>
    <h4>Navigation</h4>

    <p>The navigation bar found in the websites should be attarctive and user-friendly.The website that I have created have a simple navigation bar.The navigation bar in every pages of the websites are fixed so whenever you look at every pages the navigation of the header appear at the top so people can easily find out what are the contents that my website have and footer at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h4>Visual Appeal</h4>

    <p>Before getting started about creating the websites of mine I did a bit research about the different websites found in the internet and different portfolio which became very helpful for me to create the website.Different website found in the internet were user friendly.The color combination,font-size and different font-family used in the websites were attractive and beautiful.Not only that I also took a help from my colleauges about what are the different ,features,contents that I should have in my websites and what are the minimun criteria for making a website. </p>

    <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
    <p>So,to sum up the whole report I have made a six different websites including the first landing page(homepage),about page,cv page,social page ,contact page and the models_gp page where I have written the report of my website.In order to make these different pages of website to look attractive and user friendly I have used different html and css property where hover,animiation,transition,come under the css features.As per the assignment requirement I have also properly used the different flex property and also diferent font family.<br>
    After the completation of this assessement I have learned different ideas about how the websites should look like what are the criteria that should be consider to make the website attractive and beautiful.Since,I don't have any idea about using css and html property before so after  doing this assessement I gain ideas about building a website.</p>
